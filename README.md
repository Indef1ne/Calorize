## 📲 How to Install (Android)

Since Calorize is open-source and privacy-focused, it is not currently on the Play Store. You can install it directly on your phone.

### 1. Download the APK
Go to the [**Releases**](https://github.com/yourusername/calorize/releases) page on this repository and download the latest `app-release.apk` file to your phone.

### 2. Install
Open the downloaded file. Your phone will likely warn you about installing unknown apps.
*   Tap **Settings** (on the popup).
*   Toggle **"Allow from this source"**.
*   Tap **Install**.

### 3. ⚠️ Important: Enable Alarms & Notifications
Because this app is installed manually, modern Android versions (13+) restrict some permissions by default. To make sure **Daily Reminders** work:

1.  Open **Calorize** and go to **Settings**.
2.  Tap the **"Open Settings to Fix"** button (under Notifications) OR go to your phone's **Settings > Apps > Calorize**.
3.  Tap **Alarms & Reminders** → Turn **ON**.
